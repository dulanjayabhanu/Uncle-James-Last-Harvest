## 1. Introduction

**Uncle James’s Last Harvest** is a 3D side-scroller action-adventure game developed using Unity. The player controls Uncle James, a determined old farmer protecting his crops from mutated, oversized rats. Although the rats appear cute, they are highly dangerous due to radiation exposure from a nearby nuclear facility. The game blends shooting, movement, and collection mechanics with a humorous but intense storyline.

## 2. Game Story

Once upon a time, in a peaceful corner of the countryside, lived an old farmer named Uncle James. His life was simple, centered around growing tomatoes and cabbages on his small farm. But peace didn’t last. A radiation leak from a nearby nuclear plant mutated a group of rats, turning them into giant creatures with poisonous skin.

Though they looked innocent and adorable, these rats became a threat to his harvest. Day by day, they crept into his farm and stole his crops. With his livelihood under attack, Uncle James grabbed his AK-47 and set out to confront the threat. It was no longer just about farming — it became a fight for survival and dignity. This is the story of **Uncle James’s Last Harvest**.
